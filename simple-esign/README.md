# Digital Signatures using ether.js

### Steps:
- Creating a Random Wallet or Connecting the wallet (As a Signer)
- Declare the Message to be signed
- Signing the message ; making it a signature
- Split signature Hash
- Verify the address of the signature and message so that it matches the originating wallet signer 

### Conclusions:
- for same messages signed by same signer, all the hashes are same.
- Hence uniques is not achieved!!
